Whiteboard
===============

This is a Ruby implementation of [Johnny Chung Lee's WiiMote Whiteboard](http://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/). It runs under GNU/Linux and is based on the cwiid *library*. You need Bluetooth, a Wii Remote facing the screen or projected image, and an IR pen.

    $ git clone https://github.com/wedesoft/whiteboard.git
    $ cd whiteboard
    $ make
    $ ./whiteboard
